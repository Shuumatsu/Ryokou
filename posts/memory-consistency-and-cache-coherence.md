title: Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence
---




---

Cache coherence 
- deals with ordering of writes to a single memory location
- only needed for systems with caches 

Memory consistency 
- deals with ordering of reads/writes to all memory locations
- needed in systems with or without caches

Program-order expectation: Programmers expect memory accesses in a thread to be executed in
the same order in which they occur in the source code. 
Atomicity expectation: A read or write happens instantaneously with respect to all processors.
