This inductive reasoning principle gives us a technique to prove that a property holds for all natural numbers, which is an infinite set.

That is, we have a finite proof tree that k is a natural number, using the inference rules given


The template for inductive reasoning principle, for an inductively defined set A, is as follows.


For any property P, if
- base cases: for each axiom
$$
\frac{}{a \in A}
$$
P(a) holds.
- Inductive cases: For each inference rule
$$
\frac{a_{1} \in A \quad \cdots \quad a_{n} \in A}{a \in A}
$$
if P(a1) and . . . and P(an) then P(a).

then all $a \in A$ P(a) holds
