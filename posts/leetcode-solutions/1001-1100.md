首先判断是否是可行的：`sum(prices.map(floor)) in target-length..=target`. If so, we can switch the numbers from floored to ceiled one by one until we reach the target.

In order to minimize the rounding error, we can determine the optimal order to switch the elements. Ideally, the closer the value to ceiling, the sooner it should be switched.
