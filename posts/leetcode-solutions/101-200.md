#### 110. Balanced Binary Tree

just do it

#### 131. Palindrome Partitioning

brute force recursion

#### 134. Gas Station

find the travel length `l` of starting point `i`, the travel length of starting point in `[i .. i + j]` are no bigger than `l`

---

if the total gas is greater than costs, there must be a starting point. start `i` and start point from 0, each time `curr` reaches a negative value, set starting point to `i + 1`

#### 139. Word Break

recursion+memorization or dp

#### :a[146. LRU Cache]{href=https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/}

`HashMap<Key, Node>` & `DoublyLinkedList<Value>`

#### 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

#### :a[151. Reverse Words in a String]{href=https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/}

先反转整个字符串 in-place，再反转每个单词 in-place

#### 162. Find Peak Element

binary search, whether `m` is at a descending slope or not

#### 163. Missing Ranges
   
let `lo = lower - 1` initially, then compare each value with lo then update lo, finally check lo with upper

#### 166. Fraction to Recurring Decimal

using long division(the way we do division by hand) and a hash map to check if the current numerator has once appeared, if so, we found the repeating range. the first time the current numerator is smaller than the denomenater, place the comma

#### :a[167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted]{href=https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/}

two pointers

#### :a[170. Two Sum III - Data structure design]{href=https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-iii-data-structure-design/}

it seems that there has to be one operation's time complexity is O(n) and the other is O(1). \
then it's trivial

#### 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes

every zero comes from factors 5 \* 2, there are plenty of 2s, so the key is to find how many 5-factors.

#### 190. Reverse Bits

get every pos using bit op then construct a new one

---

every time you right shift the original number, left shift the resulting number then add 1(or 0)

#### 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

find right most of each level
