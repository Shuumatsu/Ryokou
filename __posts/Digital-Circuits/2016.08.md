1. implement a D-flip-flop
   
2. just wire input d and output q' together 

3. 

suppose `cmp(a, b) = 1 => a <= b`

implement 4-bit D-flip-flop (4DFF) module using the 1-bit D-flip-flop we implemented in part-1
    this is trivial

implement an 1-bit swap module => implement a 4-bit swap module (4SWAP) => implement a 4-compare & swap module (4CMP&SWAP)
    this is trivial

8 4DFFs are used as an array.

determine which pairs to compare & swap (using 4CMP&SWAP) based on ALT we implemented in part-2
    (pair values are from outputs of DFFs
    - if output of ALT is 1 then we compare&swap `[(i, i + 1) | i <- [0, 2, 4, 6]]` else we compare&swap `[(i, i + 1) | i <- [1, 3, 5]]`
        (this can be achieved using a 2-to-1 MUX

input of each 4DFF maybe from two types of sources, use a a 2-to-1 MUX with L being the `sel` input
    1. inputs from outside
    2. 4CMP&SWAPs
        each value will compare with either the value before it or after it, so also use a 2-to-1 MUX, with output of ALT being the `sel` input  

V is 1 iff the array is sorted, so let V be AND of all CMP
