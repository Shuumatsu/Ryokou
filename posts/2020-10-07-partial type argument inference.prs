auto as a placeholder for locations where you would like inference to occur
just as c++

more todo:
support the constraints between type level programming like:
```
type Box<T> = { value: T };

type HasBoxedNumber = Box<number>;

declare function foo<T extends Box<S>, S>(arg: T): S;

declare const hbn: HasBoxedNumber;

foo<HasBoxedNumber, infer>(hbn).toFixed();
```
or more advanced: dependent type
