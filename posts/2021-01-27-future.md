```rust
// The Context of an asynchronous task.
pub struct Context<'a> {
    waker: &'a Waker,
    _marker: PhantomData<fn(&'a ()) -> &'a ()>,
}

impl<'a> Context<'a> {
    #[inline]
    pub fn from_waker(waker: &'a Waker) -> Self { Context { waker, _marker: PhantomData } }

    #[inline]
    pub fn waker(&self) -> &'a Waker { &self.waker }
}
```
目前，Context只提供了对&Waker的访问，可以用来唤醒当前任务。

A Waker is a handle for waking up a task by notifying its executor that it is ready to be run.

```rust
// 封装了一个 RawWaker 实例，它定义了特定于执行者的唤醒行为。
pub struct Waker {
    waker: RawWaker,
}
```

---

RawWaker允许任务执行器的实现者创建一个Waker，提供自定义的唤醒行为。
它由一个数据指针和一个虚拟函数指针表（vtable）组成，可以自定义RawWaker的行为。

(不过我不明白这里为什么不用一个 trait object)

```rust
pub struct RawWaker {
    data: *const (),
    vtable: &'static RawWakerVTable,
}

impl RawWaker {
    #[inline]
    pub const fn new(data: *const (), vtable: &'static RawWakerVTable) -> RawWaker {
        RawWaker { data, vtable }
    }
}
```

---

RawWakerVTable是一个虚拟函数指针表（vtable），它指定了RawWaker的行为。

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Copy, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct RawWakerVTable {
    /// This function will be called when the [`RawWaker`] gets cloned, e.g. when
    /// the [`Waker`] in which the [`RawWaker`] is stored gets cloned.
    ///
    /// The implementation of this function must retain all resources that are
    /// required for this additional instance of a [`RawWaker`] and associated
    /// task. Calling `wake` on the resulting [`RawWaker`] should result in a wakeup
    /// of the same task that would have been awoken by the original [`RawWaker`].
    clone: unsafe fn(*const ()) -> RawWaker,

    /// This function will be called when `wake` is called on the [`Waker`].
    /// It must wake up the task associated with this [`RawWaker`].
    ///
    /// The implementation of this function must make sure to release any
    /// resources that are associated with this instance of a [`RawWaker`] and
    /// associated task.
    wake: unsafe fn(*const ()),

    /// This function will be called when `wake_by_ref` is called on the [`Waker`].
    /// It must wake up the task associated with this [`RawWaker`].
    ///
    /// This function is similar to `wake`, but must not consume the provided data
    /// pointer.
    wake_by_ref: unsafe fn(*const ()),

    /// This function gets called when a [`RawWaker`] gets dropped.
    ///
    /// The implementation of this function must make sure to release any
    /// resources that are associated with this instance of a [`RawWaker`] and
    /// associated task.
    drop: unsafe fn(*const ()),
}
```

--- 

```rust
pub trait Future {
    type Output;

    // 在多次调用轮询时，只有最近一次调用所传递的 Context 中的 Waker 应该被安排接收唤醒。
    // 一旦 future 已经完成就不应被再次轮循
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}
```

Future 是惰性的，它们必须被主动轮询才能取得进展，这意味着每次当前任务被唤醒时，它应该主动地重新轮询它仍有兴趣的待定 future。

When poll is invoked, the future attempts to advance its internal state as much as possible.

---

The executor is responsible for calling Future::poll on the outer future, driving the asynchronous computation to completion.
